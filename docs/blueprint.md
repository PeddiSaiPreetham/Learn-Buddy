# **App Name**: Pythonic Tasks

## Core Features:

- Add Task: Add a new task to the to-do list via a simple form.
- View Tasks: View all tasks, with completed tasks visually distinguished.
- Complete Tasks: Mark tasks as complete with a toggle.
- Smart Task Suggestion: Generate smart suggestions for organizing tasks based on similar tasks.
- Effort Estimation: Use an LLM to analyze the tasks and estimate the effort using an abstract unit like "story points". The LLM acts as a 'tool' suggesting an initial point value, and you may then manually adjust it based on personal context.
